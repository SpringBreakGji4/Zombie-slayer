### Photon
Photon is a popular third-party SDK that provides a cloud-based multiplayer platform for real-time games and applications. Our project utilizes Photon for its powerful multiplayer features and scalability. With Photon, we were able to easily create and manage multiplayer functionality in our VR shooting game.

To use Photon in our project, we first downloaded and imported the Photon Unity Networking (PUN) package from the Unity Asset Store. We then configured our game objects and scripts to use Photon's network infrastructure to synchronize player movement, shooting, and zombie spawning across multiple devices in real-time. Photon's cloud-based server infrastructure also ensures reliable and low-latency multiplayer experiences for our users.
