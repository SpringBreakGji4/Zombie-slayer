MiLab Cardboard Extension Version 1.0.2

Original version of the Extension to Cardboard: https://github.com/joaoborks/cardboard-xr-plugin/tree/feature/xr_interaction

Minor tweaks were made by MiLab to toggle automatically clicking objects when gazed at, and extract the relevant scripts to an easily downloaded package.

Additionally, some scripts were provided to facillitate character movement and debugging inputs from the Bluetooth Controllers given in class.


Tested on Google Cardboard XR Plugin version 1.19.0
