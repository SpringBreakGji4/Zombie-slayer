# Stylized Textures - MiniSet

Hello World! I hope you will like this free stylized textures miniset.

The textures are setup for Physically Based Rendering (PBR).

## Texture Filenames

Texture type can be easily determined by its filename suffix.

_d - Diffuse (Base Color)
_n - Normal (DirectX format)
_mr - Metallic-Roughness (R channel is Metallic, Alpha channel is Roughness)
_ao - Ambient Occlusion
_h - Height

### Example

t_stylized_sand_d.png - Diffuse
t_stylized_sand_n.png - Normal
t_stylized_sand_mr.png - Metallic-Roughness
t_stylized_sand_ao.png - Ambient Occlusion
t_stylized_sand_h.png - Height

### Filename Prefixes

All filenames also have prefixes, which determine the type of the file:

t_ - Texture
m_ - Material
sc_ - Scene

This is only a naming convention I have been using for many years and I find it very usefull. You can easily search for files in a project. Of course you can rename all the files if you prefer some other way.
